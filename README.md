# OneLoveIPFS Uploader

Cross-platform IPFS uploader for 3Speak and DTube. Can be run as a standalone upload server or a locally-running Electron app. Also supports Skynet protocol.

### Dependencies required

* `nodejs` and `npm` (Latest LTS, v16 minimum supported)
* `ffmpeg`, `imagemagick` and `bc` for sprite generation
* `kubo` (formerly `go-ipfs`) with a running daemon (alternatively [IPFS Desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop) may be used)

### Additional requirements

* A HiveSigner application (if HiveSigner authentication is used)
* A running `skyd` node for Skynet upload support.
* `tusd` running daemon when running as standalone upload server, which can be installed and configured [here](https://github.com/oneloveipfs/ipfsVideoUploader/blob/master/docs/ResumableUploads.md#server-installation).

# Installation

There are several ways in which OneLoveIPFS uploader can be installed and run.

* [Manual CLI install](https://github.com/oneloveipfs/ipfsVideoUploader/blob/master/docs/Installation.md)
* [Manual desktop app compile](https://github.com/oneloveipfs/ipfsVideoUploader/blob/master/docs/Compile.md)
* [Prebuilt desktop app](https://github.com/oneloveipfs/ipfsVideoUploader/releases)

# Configuration

The ways in which configuration is done depends on how OneLoveIPFS uploader is run. The options may be found [here](https://github.com/oneloveipfs/ipfsVideoUploader/blob/master/docs/ConfigDocs.md).

OneLoveIPFS data dir, which is the working directory for uploader databases and files can be set with `ONELOVEIPFS_DATA_DIR` environment variable.

# Supported file formats

IPFS works the best for videos with .mp4, however `video/mp4` and `video/quicktime` mime types will be supported. JPG, PNG and GIF file formats are supported for thumbnail uploads.

# RESTful HTTP API & IPSync

API calls for authentication, file uploads, hashes and usage data are documented [here](https://github.com/oneloveipfs/ipfsVideoUploader/blob/master/docs/API.md). Resumable video upload API documentation may be found [here](https://github.com/oneloveipfs/ipfsVideoUploader/blob/master/docs/ResumableUploads.md).

# Important notice on 3Speak uploads

All 3Sepak videos **MUST** go through 3Speak's centralized API and encoding system as of v3.0 release. There is no other way to get them to play on 3speak.tv website.
