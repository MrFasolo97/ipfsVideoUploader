                    <tr><td>Stuck in upload queue? You can skip it by using our upload servers instead! IPFS operations are handled asynchronously, means there's no need to wait for others' to complete adding files to IPFS to add your outstanding video to the network!</td></tr>

                    <tr><td>DTube servers down? Old videos unplayable on DTube? Our uploader uploads your video straight to the public IPFS gateway, without involving DTube's upload servers. Your video will remain playable even during DTube's downtime, as long as it is available in the IPFS network!</td></tr>
